<h2>About TechMeetup</h2>

<p>We founded the TechMeetup because there is an abundance of events for entrepreneurs to meet investors and lawyers, and next to nothing for techies and tech. Considering the wealth of tech talent around (yes you), why haven’t we made the effort before to get to know everyone – see what else everyone is working on – get help on our projects from others – and talk about some of the cool stuff we’re doing – web apps, software, mobile apps, hardware, games…</p>

<p>Networking sounds like something that you do if you’re in PR or sales, so we don’t call it that and we don’t make it feel like that. There’s no name badges, no canapés. There’s just pizza and beer, a projector and a load of techies arguing about stuff. Come along to a TechMeetup and meet who else is involved in your tech scene.</p>

<p>Some other things of relevance</p>

<ol>
  <li>TechMeetup is free.</li>
  <li>TechMeetup is about advancing our knowledge and meeting new people – it is not for presenting a sales pitch.</li>
  <li>TechMeetup is organised and run by the community. This thing would not work without the incredible contributions from a fantastic group of people. And they are, as follows.
   <ul>
     <li>Sam Collins, Founder, Eventasaurus, <a href="http://twitter.com/smcllns">@smcllns</a></li>
     <li>Douglas McCallum, Founder, Agamik</li>

<h2>Support TechMeetup & Donate</h2>
<p>
The three TechMeetups (Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow) are organized and run by volunteers, who do so for the love of it. However we need your help because together we drink and eat our way through £7680 of beer, soft drink, and pizza every year. Our fantastic sponsors  pay for most of it but we need your help to get to the finish line.
</p>
<p>
Right now we can't take any credit card or Paypal payments so we ask you to "bank transfer" your donation. You could either donate one lump sum or set up a standing order of £5 or £10 / month as some do.
